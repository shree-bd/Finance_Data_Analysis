# Finance-Data-Analysis

# Data Description:
The .xls file contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.

# Context: 
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.

# Deatailed Report

# 1. Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze financial data to extract meaningful insights and trends. The primary objectives include:

Identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) for financial health assessment.
Detecting patterns and anomalies in financial data.
Providing actionable insights for stakeholders to make informed decisions.

# 2. Libraries Used
The following libraries were utilized for data processing, analysis, and visualization:

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Utilized for numerical computing.
Matplotlib: Employed for creating static visualizations.
Seaborn: Utilized for statistical data visualization.
Plotly: Used for interactive and dynamic visualizations.

# 3. Charts Used
Various types of charts were generated to visualize the financial data effectively. These include:

Line Charts: Used to illustrate trends over time, such as revenue or expenses.
Bar Charts: Utilized for comparing different categories of financial data, e.g., quarterly profits.
Pie Charts: Employed to show the composition of total values, e.g., distribution of expenses by category.
Scatter Plots: Utilized to explore relationships between variables, such as correlation between revenue and marketing spend.
Heatmaps: Used to visualize correlations or patterns in a matrix format.
Box Plots: Employed for visualizing the distribution of a dataset and detecting outliers.

# 4. Handling Outliers
Outliers in the financial data were identified and addressed using a heuristic approach, which involved:

Outlier Detection: Outliers were detected using statistical methods such as z-score analysis or interquartile range (IQR) method.
Handling Outliers: Depending on the context and impact of outliers on the analysis, several strategies were employed:
Removal: Outliers deemed as errors or anomalies were removed from the dataset.
Transformation: Outliers were transformed using techniques such as winsorization or log transformation to reduce their influence on statistical analysis.
Capping: Outliers were capped at a certain threshold to mitigate their impact without entirely removing them from the dataset.

# 5. Final Results and Summary
After thorough analysis of the financial data, the following key insights and results were obtained:

Identified trends and patterns in revenue, expenses, and profitability over time.
Detected anomalies or irregularities in financial metrics that warrant further investigation.
Established correlations between different financial indicators, enabling better understanding of cause-and-effect relationships.
Provided actionable recommendations for optimizing financial performance and mitigating risks.

In summary, this project successfully analyzed financial data to provide valuable insights for decision-making processes, ultimately contributing to better financial management and strategic planning.
